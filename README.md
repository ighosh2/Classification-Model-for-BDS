#Fortuneâ€™s Origin: Machine Learning Insights into Self-Made Versus Inherited Billionaire Wealth


This project applies machine learning to analyze the origins of billionaires' wealth, categorizing them into self-made or inherited. It aims to explore global wealth distribution patterns by cleaning and analyzing data, using PCA, logistic regression, and advanced classifiers like SVM and Random Forest. Feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning refine the model for accuracy and generalizability. The effectiveness of models is compared using F1 scores, confusion matrices, and ROC curves, aiming to provide insights into wealth creation and inheritance through a data-driven approach.
